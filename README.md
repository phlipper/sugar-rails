# sugar-rails

[Sugar](http://sugarjs.com/), tastefully bundled for the Rails 3.0 and up. Sweet!


## Rails 3.1+

For Rails 3.1 and greater, the files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use.

To enable:

* Add the following line to the file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` (or other [sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) manifest):

``` javascript
//= require sugar
```

* You can choose some special distribution writing following:

``` javascript
//= require sugar-core
//= require sugar-dates
//= require sugar-inflections

//= require sugar-dates-only
```

See more details on http://sugarjs.com/customize

### Installation

* Add `sugar-rails` to your Gemfile
* Run `bundle`

Enjoy!


## Rails 3.0

This gem adds a single generator to Rails 3, `sugar:install`. Running the generator will install the JavaScript file necessary to use Sugar.

### Installation

* Add `sugar-rails` to your Gemfile
* Run `bundle`
* Invoke the generator: `rails generate sugar:install`
* Add the following to your layout or view files:

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag "sugar" %>
```

You're done!
